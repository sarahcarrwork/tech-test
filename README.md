## Top Tips
To help get you started, a skeleton project has been setup with the necessary dependencies.

- Run the following command before starting:
```bash
npm install
```

- Be sure to check that everything is working before you write any code by running this command:
```bash
npm test
```
If all is well, you should see something similar to this output:


- Make sure your code is tested! To this end, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) has been installed to run your unit tests.
